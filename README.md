## Description

This is the Android client for my [Android Malware Classifier](https://github.com/MartGon/MalwareClassifier).

After launching the app, you can select the APK from your system which you would like to analyze. Once the analysis is over, a number will displayed. This number is a percent of how likely this application is to be a malware sample. The lower this value is, the better.

# About

I've tested the application with itself and it gave it 12.5% as result.
